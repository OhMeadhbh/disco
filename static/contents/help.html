  <h3>The Discovery Web Desktop</h3>

  <p>
     Hi! Thanks for trying out the Discovery Web Desktop (we call it "Disco"
     for short.) This document will hopefully get you on your way to
     using Disco effectively.
  </p>

  <h4>What is Disco?</h4>

  <p>
    Disco is a web application that emulates a desktop experience. You do the
    same things with Disco you would do with your Macintosh, Windows or
    Gnome desktop interfaces. But with Disco, you're doing it in the cloud.
    Changes to documents and applications (even the Disco desktop) are
    saved on a remote server. Changes you make on one computer will
    automagically show up on any other computer you log in from.
    A web-based desktop also has the benefit of centrally managed backups and
    easy software distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disco was designed to be used on both desktop and tablet computers. But
    unfortunately it's only currently compatible with Mozilla, Chrome and
    Safari web browsers.
  </p>

  <h4>Okay. How do I do things with Disco?</h4>

  <p>
    Working with Disco is very much like working with any other desktop
    interface. Mouse users point at screen controls with the mouse and activate
    them by clicking. Tablet users just touch the interface element they're
    interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along the top of the screen is the Menu Bar; clicking menu items on the 
    menu bar will either cause a sub-menu to open or an action to be performed.
    Portions of the Menu Bar will change as you move between applications,
    though all apps share the glider menu, the help window and the full screen
    control, denoted with these icons:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/logo.png"></td>
      <td>Glider Menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/help.png"></td>
      <td>Help Window</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/fullscreen.png"></td>
      <td>Full-Screen Control</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    <strong>The Glider Menu</strong> contains a number of 
    sub-menu items which give you access to application settings and commonly
    used accessories such as a calculator and a clock. The <strong>Help
      Window</strong> icon opens this help window. The <strong>Full Screen
      Control</strong> toggles in and out of full screen on browsers that
    support it.
  </p>
