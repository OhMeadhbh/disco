    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
      Rather than giving you a list of API calls
      you could have figured out by glancing at the code, I'm going to talk
      about what I was thinking when I made the APIs and how to build a
      sample application.

    <h3>Disclaimers</h3>

    <h4>Everything You Know is Wrong</h4>

    <p>
      Everything you read here may be wrong. Sucktastic documentation is
      a characteristic of open source projects. But I'm going to make an
      effort to keep these docs somewhat up to date. I hate it when
      developers respond to my queries by saying "the source code is
      self-documenting (you idiot)" which is a total crock of stuff we
      can't really mention in software documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If something in this document doesn't make sense, get some coffee and see
      if it makes sense later. If it still doesn't make sense (you're going to
      hate this) take a look at the source code. It's possible I messed up or
      just haven't updated the docs. You're a skilled coding ninja, you might
      just spot the error. If you still can't figure it out, feel free to
      drop me a line and I'll try to answer your question as best I can.

    <h4>Prepare to be Sadly Disappointed</h4>

    <p>
      You know that verbage in end user licenses that says "no representations
      are made about the suitability of this softare for any purpose" ?? I've
      always sort of wondered what that means since softare companies spend
      millions (if not billions) of dollars every year trying to convince you
      their brand of bits is the niftiest thing since sliced bread.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know, I know... It's boilerplate legalese crafted to prevent nuisance
      law suits when someone tries to say "You didn't tell me your software wouldn't
      make me waffles!" when it's clear all software is suitable for making crepes.
      This software doesn't make waffles. It actualy doesn't even make crepes. That is,
      unless you add a crepe-making application yourself, in which case it's not
      my fault your crepe-making app doesn't work, so buzz off.
    </p>

    <p>
      No... there's no warranty on this software or it's documentation. If it does
      something useful, it's probably a complete accident and the result of a bug
      that will be removed in the next version of the code. And not only are no
      representations made about the suitability of this software (or it's
      documentation) for any particular purpose, you will be sadly disappointed if
      if you expect it to even work.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, the way it doesn't work is the niftiest thing since bread
      started coming sliced. If this software happens to randomly make you a waffle,
      please let me know about it.
