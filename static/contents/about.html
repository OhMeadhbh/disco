  <h3>About the Discovery Web Desktop</h3>

  <p>
     Hi! Thanks for trying out the Discovery Web Desktop (we call it "Disco"
     for short.) This document will hopefully get you on your way to
     using Disco effectively.
  </p>

  <h4>What is Disco?</h4>

  <p>
    Disco is a web application that emulates a desktop experience. You do the
    same things with Disco you would do with your Macintosh, Windows or
    Gnome desktop interfaces. But with Disco, you're doing it in the cloud.
    Changes to documents and applications (even the Disco desktop) are
    saved on a remote server. Changes you make on one computer will
    automagically show up on any other computer you log in from.
    A web-based desktop also has the benefit of centrally managed backups and
    easy software distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disco was designed to be used on both desktop and tablet computers. But
    unfortunately it's only currently compatible with Chrome and
    Safari web browsers.
  </p>

  <h4>Free / Libre / Open Source</h4>

    Some of the icons used on this site are reminiscent of Susan Kare's original Mac Icon set, but are in fact loving replicas
    made with GIMP. We did want to shout-out to Susan, since her work is especially awesome. Here's a link to <a href="http://www.kare.com/" target="_blank">www.kare.com</a>, her professional site.
