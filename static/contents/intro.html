  <p>
    Welcome to Discovery, a web desktop.
  </p>

  <p>
    With equal parts homage and parody, Discovery provides users with a computer desktop in a web
    browser. Discovery is "Free and Open Source Software" meaning you can use it on any system you
    wish. This means you can install it on a home server to provide a uniform, shared experience
    between your desktop, laptop, tablet and even smart-phone systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    We use it to provide a user interface to our home systems so our sensitive data can stay where it belongs,
    on a hard drive we own. But at the same time you can access data in the cloud. Discovery lets you decide
    where your data lives: in the cloud, with the convenience it affords, or on a local server you own, with
    the security and access control you prefer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like another small system built 30 years ago, Discovery keeps the user in control while doing simple,
    insanely great things.
  </p>
