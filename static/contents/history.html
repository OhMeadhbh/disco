  <h3>History of the Discovery Web Desktop</h3>

  <p>
    I guess it all started when I was 10 years old and saw Smalltalk running
    for the first time. After binge-watching Star Trek re-runs and saying I
    really wanted a computer, just like Spock's, my dad did a pretty super thing.
    He arranged for me to meet with some of his contacts at UIUC. In 1978, I got
    to see an IBM mainframe, a DEC PDP-10 and a version of Smalltalk-76 someone
    had smuggled out of Xerox/PARC.
  </p>

  <p>
    My dad had been telling me that computers were large things that filled
    entire data centers (he was a mainframe-guy) but was assured by his
    contacts at UIUC the TRS-80 we had seen at Radio Shack was indeed, a "real"
    computer with input / output, stored programs and the whole lot. The next
    week we bought a used TRS-80 and the rest is history.
  </p>

  <p>
    After several years of building microcomputers (I still have the wire-wrap
    scars) and seeing early windowing environments on Xerox and TI workstations,
    I finally got some sit-down time with a real personal computer with a "real"
    windowing system. The local business computer shop that sold mostly Apple II's
    was trying to find someone who could write a few demo programs for this new
    Lisa system they just got from Apple. I traded them face-time on the Lisa for
    a few simple programs demoing features they thought had been overlooked in the
    Apple promo materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    You never forget your first love, and mine was a computer called Lisa. Okay,
    sure, Adam Ant was my first love, but let's just say the Lisa was the first love
    I got to spend time with (though if Stuart Goddard is reading this... call me!)
    This project began mostly as a Lisa emulator written in JavaScript targeting SDL
    on a local machine. I may eventually get back to working on that.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time I was testing out node.js bindings for SDL by writing
    a Lisa emulator, I kept hearing about this company called Carbyn. They were making
    a Web Operating System that didn't suck. If you've used Jolicloud or G.ho.st, you
    know the state of the art of web desktop systems sort of sucks. And then out of
    nowhere, Carbyn was sucked up by another company and disappeared into the vapour
    of the software industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Convinced no one was going to make a web desktop I wanted to use, I decided
    to make my own. And Discovery is the first baby-step towards that goal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Discovery mixes my interest in web operating systems with my passion for old computers
    and enabling people through the use of technology. The default theme for Disco is
    reminiscent of the early Macintosh systems for a reason. The Mac really did change the
    personal computing landscape. As limited as early Macs were, they offered a "workstation-like"
    experience in a package that was affordable to many people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, if you talk to the people involved (Andy Hertzfeld, Burrell Smith, Dan Kottke, Guy Kawasaki, etc.)
    the passion in their voices is palpable. They weren't just making another widget for a
    VC funded ad-fueled startup, they were changing the world. And honestly, I really miss that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disco is intended to change the world in a small way. It's built to run on your own server inside your own house.
    If you like it, you can poke a hole though your firewall so you can access it from your office. Or you can use it
    to access cloud based resources "out there" on machines run by large companies who do this sort of thing professionally.
    How you use it is up to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    The history of the Discovery Web Desktop is incomplete, because (like you, the user) it keeps growing. If you don't
    like what you see, keep coming back, we're adding functionality all the time.
