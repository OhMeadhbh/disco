Basic Font Information
----------------------

Grana Padano is a medium-weight upright sans-serif font in roughly the same
family as Apple Computer's historic Chicago font.  It has support for Latin
and Cyrillic character sets, containing sufficient characters for Latin-0
through Latin-10, as well as Vietnamese and basic Cyrillic (plus Ukraininan
additions).  It uses OpenType tables for diacritic placement.
