  <h3>The Discovery Web Desktop</h3>

  <p>
    Working with Disco is very much like working with any other desktop
    interface. Mouse users point at screen controls with the mouse and activate
    them by clicking. Tablet users just touch the interface element they're
    interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along the top of the screen is the Menu Bar; clicking menu items on the 
    menu bar will either cause a sub-menu to open or an action to be performed.
    Portions of the Menu Bar will change as you move between applications,
    though all apps share the glider menu, the help window and the full screen
    control, denoted with these icons:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/logo.png"></td>
      <td>Glider Menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/help.png"></td>
      <td>Help Window</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="img/fullscreen.png"></td>
      <td>Full-Screen Control</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    <strong>The Glider Menu</strong> contains a number of 
    sub-menu items which give you access to application settings and commonly
    used accessories such as a calculator and a clock. The <strong>Help
      Window</strong> icon opens this help window. The <strong>Full Screen
      Control</strong> toggles in and out of full screen on browsers that
    support it.
